# Rekall-Pentration-Test-Project-and-Report
An offensive security project in which an attack is conducted against the fictional organization Rekall Corporation and determine its vulnerabilities.
A three-day project, with each individual day devoted to targeting specific servers belonging to the fictional organzation. On Day 1, you'll attempt to exploit vulnerabilities on the organization's web application. On Day 2, you'll exploit the organization's Linux servers, and on Day 3, you'll exploit the organization's Windows servers.

The project is structured as a Capture the Flag (CTF) style competition, so that each vulnerability that you exploit correlates with a "flag," and flags are worth various point amounts depending on the difficulty level of the exploit.

You will summarize your findings and recommended mitigations in a penetration testing summary report. A framework for the report will be provided. This report will be your final project deliverable.


For the majority of this week's demonstrations and activities, you will use an Azure Lab that contains each day's activities.



Day 1 Activity Guide:

Attacking the Web Application CTF

Project Scenario


For this week’s project, Project 2, you will play the role of penetration testers hired to conduct a penetration testing engagement by Rekall Corporation.
Rekall Corporation is a fictional company that specializes in offering virtual reality experiences based on images that customers upload.
These experiences could include dream vacations, adventures, or even secret missions.
Rekall guarantees that these virtual reality experiences will feel real.
Rekall is about to go live with their business, and they need penetration testers to find any vulnerabilities within their technical systems.
Rekall has a brand new web application and several Windows and Linux servers that manage their businesses.
You are tasked with using the offensive security skills that you’ve learned over the last couple of weeks to find any vulnerabilities in Rekall’s technical infrastructure and summarize the appropriate mitigations.
As you go through this week’s activities, be sure to update this penetration testing summary report, which you’ll submit upon completion of Project 2.
   
    
    
Day 2 Activity Guide


Attacking Rekall’s Linux Servers CTF

Project Scenario

For this week’s project, you’re playing the role of penetration testers hired to conduct a penetration testing engagement by Rekall Corporation.
On Day 1, you found vulnerabilities within Rekall Corporation’s web application.
Today, you will continue to exploit Rekall’s technical infrastructure, but you’ll focus on the organization’s Linux servers and vulnerabilities related to Linux operating systems.
Like you did on Day 1, you will also find “flags” during your exploitation.
As you work through the project, remember to continue completing your required deliverable, the penetration testing summary report, and to take screenshots of your exploits that you'll include in this report.



Day 3 Activity Guide


Attacking Rekall’s Windows Servers CTF


Project Scenario
For this week’s project, you’re playing the role of penetration testers hired to conduct a penetration testing engagement by Rekall Corporation.
On Day 1, you found vulnerabilities within Rekall Corporation’s web application.
On Day 2, you found vulnerabilities within Rekall Corporation’s Linux Servers.
Today, you will continue to exploit Rekall's technical infrastructure, but you’ll focus on the organization’s Windows servers and vulnerabilities related to Windows operating systems.
Like you did on Days 1 and 2, you will also find “flags” during your exploitation.
As you work through the project, remember to continue completing your required deliverable, the penetration testing summary report, and to take screenshots of your exploits that you’ll include in this report.
